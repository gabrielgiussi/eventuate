COMMENT IN THE PR
15. We should be able to define specific state serialization for custom crdt like AWSet
   (supposing this represent an improvement in performance)
   For be able to do this, I should create the class AWSet (but I can't extend case class)
   So i guess i would have to include an optional type in the CRDT case class to apply
   pattern matching in the CRDTSerializer
   Unless I apply pattern matching over the state directly!

21. The use of VectorTime.Zero.increment("a")

22. SimpleCRDT, Seq[Operation] or Seq[Versioned[Operation]]

23. Receive implicit ops in Services
