1. Porque me tira este error en los test?
   could not find implicit value for parameter ops: com.rbmhtechnology.eventuate.crdt.CRDTServiceOps[scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int]]
   Se soluciona importando el companion object import ORSet._ donde se define implict def CRDTServiceOps,
   pero antes no se necesitaba!

2. test PureOp NonCommutative framework

5. document things

7. Ask Carlos
   a) AWSet is the PureOp based ORSet?
   b) Even more, an add operation a cannot
      be removed despite the presence of concurrent rmv operation r (as one might think). The
      reason is that r can become stable at any time; if it happened to be followed by a clear
      operation, i.e., in its causal future, all stable operations in the PO-Log will be deleted, r
      among them. Since a is not yet stable, and thus concurrent with clear, the former will
      stay in the PO-Log. This breaks the remove-wins semantics since r and a were originally
      concurrent and hence r should win. These reasons lead to a more complex stabilize function
      (explained next) that is in charge of removing the extra operations that were not safe to be
      removed previously through R or R _ .

      Doesn't make sense to me
   c) EWFlag is just an AWSet where we can only add/rmv a single fixed element. Example: 1
      It would only make sense if it could return (enabled,disabled,unset)
      but it only contains Enable so we could not differentiate between disabled an unset.

    d) Can add quotes to eventuate source code?

8. RWSet, EWFlag

11. Restrict the access to POLog and state, and method like addOp

12. The PureOp framework doesn't lack a pruneState or updateState?
    In the framework, the AWSet bug doesn't happen because the prune of the POLOG should
    discard stable operatios (with VectorTime = zero). I could do that, but then the framework will be restricted
    to a state made of stable ops, and not a specific set for example.

13. FIX ChaosTestSpec

14. Control in test that we don't try to add twice
the same VectorTime, or add VectorTime concurrent to those that we mark as stable

15. Review The serialization of the CRDT State

16. FIX the need of import the object that contains the ops def for instantiate the service (before this wasn't needed)

17. FIX the need of this two imports in tests
    import TPSet._
    import CRDTUtils.TPSetCRDT

18. Fix the need of specify the ops in ReplicatedAWSetSpec
    new AWSetService[Int]("A", endpoint.log)(system, AWSet.AWSetServiceOps)
